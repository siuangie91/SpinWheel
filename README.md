# Wheel Spin #

***Summary:*** *Rotate wheel via the path of least resistance (i.e., counterclockwise or clockwise, whichever path is shortest) such that the clicked icon is at the top.*

**Demo:** [http://projects.angiesiudevworks.com/spinwheel/](http://projects.angiesiudevworks.com/spinwheel/)

************************************************************

When an icon is clicked, wheel should rotate via the path of least resistance (i.e., counterclockwise or clockwise, whichever path is shortest) such that the clicked icon is at the top.

The content inside the icon should always remain upright.

The active icon should be the largest and the icon at the bottom should be smallest (base size). The ones adjacent to the active icon should be medium sized (one size smaller than large) and the ones adjacent to the bottom icon should be small sized (one size smaller than medium, i.e., one size bigger than base).

## Updated ##

The wheel is now responsive and corresponding content is shown when icon is clicked. Below 900px, the interface collapses into accordion mode.
